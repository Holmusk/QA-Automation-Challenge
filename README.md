# QA-Automation-Challenge

`version 1.0`
`challenge status: open`

Welcome! We've been expecting you. Holmusk is a big data based high tech company with the vision to use data science to revolutionize healthcare worldwide.

If you're someone who bleeds code and aches to make a difference in the world, then you are at the right place. You will be part of a world‑class team working on the most exciting ground‑breaking technology in an inspiring and collaborative environment.


## Basics

This is the Holmusk Quality Assurance Automation challenge. The rules of the challenge are as follows:

* Your code should be commented.
* Because we, at Holmusk, take code organization seriously, please do ensure your source files are organized when you submit.
* Please complete the challenge and email your solution in a zip file to viethai.pham@holmusk.com along with instructions on how to execute your program.
* Please note that you will also be judged on the elegance of your code, level of abstraction and technical skills presented in the implementation. For more details, refer to the Judging Criteria section below.

## The Challenge 

### What You'll need to build

You will need to create a test script that can select any date from a date picker. Since the date picker is implemented differently on Android and iOS (and even across Android SDK versions), your script must handle the following cases:
- iOS 10.3
- Android SDK 18
- Android SDK 22
- Android SDK 23

### Bits and Pieces to take note of
* The source code for the Android TestApplication can be found at:

> https://github.com/Holmusk/TestApplicationQA-Android.git

* The source code for the iOS TestApplication can be found at:

> https://github.com/Holmusk/TestApplicationQA-iOS.git

* Feel free to raise issues on the respective application pages if you have trouble compiling them.
* You must use Java and Appium to write your tests. TestNG is preferred, but JUnit is fine as well.

## Judging Criteria
* What you have produced will determine your final outcome.
* Because we love people who have a passion for expanding their horizons, your background with test frameworks do not matter so much provided you are able to demonstrate your learning ability!

## Bonus
* The test script can launch the emulator/simulator, deploy apk/app file and launch the app.
* **Major points** will be awarded if you use **RxJava** to power the automation.

** With that said we wish you good luck and look forward to receiving your submission!
